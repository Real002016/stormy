# Stormy
- Based on an early build of https://github.com/syz66/illusion (Which is based on raven). (DELISTED)
- ClickGUI key is ENTER.
- Made for [Weave](https://github.com/Weave-MC).
## Goal
- My goal with this project is to make my own custom client using Raven as a base without worrying about skidding too much. 
- I want this client to be a hybrid client, but mainly blatant.
## Modules + CGUI
Key:
- ❌ = incomplete/unsatisfactory
- ✅ = implemented and functional
