# Stormy
- Based on an early build of https://github.com/syz66/illusion (Which is based on raven). (Syz has quit developing and delisted his repository.)
- ClickGUI key is ENTER.
- Made for Weave mod loader
## Goal
- My goal with this project is to make my own custom client using Raven as a base without worrying about skidding too much. 
- I want this client to be a hybrid client, but mainly blatant.
## Modules (If checked they have logic)
